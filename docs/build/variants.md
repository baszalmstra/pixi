# Tutorial: Adding variants

In this tutorial, we will show you how to use variants in order to build a pixi package against different versions of a dependency.

!!! warning
    Variants are currently not stable and the format is likely to change in future releases. Please keep this in mind while using them in your projects.

## Why is this useful?

When we depend on a pixi package, all the dependencies match specs of that pixi package are already set.
For example, the [`pixi_build_cpp` example](cpp.md) was depending on Python 3.12.
Therefore, we cannot depend on `pixi_build_cpp` and use a different Python version.
By using variants, we can add a set of allowed matchspecs for a specific dependency.
Pixi will then resolve the package with all the different variants.

## Let's get started

In this tutorial we will extend the [workspace example](workspace.md) so we can test it against multiple Python versions.
As a reminder, we ended up with a top-level `pixi.toml` containing the workspace and the Python package `rich_example`.
Our workspace then depended on `rich_example` as well as a C++ package with exposed Python bindings called `python_binding`.

```toml title="pixi.toml"
--8<-- "docs/source_files/pixi_projects/pixi_build_workspace_variants/pixi.toml:dependencies"
```

The file tree looks like this:

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ python_bindings
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ pixi.toml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ src
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ bindings.cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ pixi.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ pixi.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ rich_example
        â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
```

The problem is that our Python version is bound to 3.12 as this is what we specified in the `host-dependencies` of `python_bindings`.
In order to allow multiple Python versions we first have to change the version requirement to `*`.

```toml title="packages/python_bindings/pixi.toml" hl_lines="4"
--8<-- "docs/source_files/pixi_projects/pixi_build_workspace_variants/packages/python_bindings/pixi.toml:host-dependencies"
```

1. Used to be "3.12.*"

Now, we have to specify the Python versions we want to allow.
We do that in `workspace.build-variants`:

```toml title="pixi.toml"
--8<-- "docs/source_files/pixi_projects/pixi_build_workspace_variants/pixi.toml:variants"
```

If we'd run `pixi install` now, we'd leave it up to pixi whether to use Python 3.11 or 3.12.
In practice, you will want to create multiple environments specifying a different dependency match spec.
In our case this allows us to test our setup against both Python 3.11 and 3.12.


```toml title="pixi.toml"
--8<-- "docs/source_files/pixi_projects/pixi_build_workspace_variants/pixi.toml:environments"
```

By running `pixi list` we can see the Python version used in each environment.
You can also see that the `Build` value of `python_bindings` differ between `py311` and `py312`.
That means that a different package has been built for each variant.
Since `rich_example` only contains Python source code, the package itself doesn't depend on the Python version, it is `noarch`.
Therefore, the build string is the same.


```pwsh
$ pixi list --environment py311
Package            Version     Build               Size       Kind   Source
python             3.11.11     h9e4cc4f_1_cpython  29.2 MiB   conda  python
python_bindings    0.1.0       py311h43a39b2_0                conda  python_bindings
rich_example       0.1.0       pyhbf21a9e_0                   conda  rich_example
```

```pwsh
$ pixi list --environment py312
Package            Version     Build               Size       Kind   Source
python             3.12.8      h9e4cc4f_1_cpython  30.1 MiB   conda  python
python_bindings    0.1.0       py312h2078e5b_0                conda  python_bindings
rich_example       0.1.0       pyhbf21a9e_0                   conda  rich_example
```


## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we showed how to use variants to build multiple versions of a single package.
We built `python_bindings` for Python 3.12 and 3.13, which allows us to test whether it works properly on both Python versions.
Variants are not limited to a single dependency, you could for example try to test multiple versions of `nanobind`.
